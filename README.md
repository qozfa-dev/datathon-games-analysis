# datathon-games-analysis

This project was created for the Games Datathon, where the goal was to analyze player behavior and engagement patterns using in-game activity data.  
Using Python and data visualization libraries, I explored how players spend time, earn rewards, and interact across different activity types and platforms.

This project analyzes player activity data from a Games Datathon.  
Using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the notebook explores:

- Time spent on different activity types
- Distribution of rewards (Money and RP) per activity
- Player engagement across platforms
